## Getting Started with repl.it

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a> is a very flexible online tool that can be used to code in many different languages. This program is the most open-ended high level online programming environment currently available.</li>
  <li>To start coding, create a repl, choose a language and start typing. Most languages you can think of are available on this site.</li>
  <li>Repl.it may also be used by teachers to deliver courses to students. Create a teacher account, and browse the available resources. All resources are customizable, or you may create your own. </li>
  <li>For unpaid subscriptions, all your content is public. When your teacher account is verified, repl.it may upgrade your account to private.</li>
