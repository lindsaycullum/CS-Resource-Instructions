## Getting Started with Khan Academy

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> is an online platform that allows students to learn about computer science (and many other STEM subjects) in an interactive, self-directed way.  This is another easy way to provide instruction for those who are fed up with drag and drop. Activities are auto-marked, so students get immediate feedback. Program can be run as self-directed learning, so teacher is able to focus on helping the students who are struggling. 
  </li>
  <li>To get started, go to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming" target="_blank">Unit: Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Try out some of the activities from this unit. The content starts as appropriate for Junior Students, and moves up to concepts that are generally introduced in high school.</li>
  <li>Like CMU CS Academy, Khan Academy has a teacher interface that allows registering of students and overviewing their progress.</li>
