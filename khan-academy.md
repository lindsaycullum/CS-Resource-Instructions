## Getting Started with Khan Academy

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> is an online platform that allows students to learn about computer science (and many other STEM subjects) in an interactive, self-directed way.  This is another easy way to provide instruction for those who are fed up with drag and drop. Activities are auto-marked, so students get immediate feedback. Program can be run as self-directed learning, so teacher is able to focus on helping the students who are struggling.
