    <p>Try out the tutorial to get a feel for the student experience. The educator guide will give you ideas on how to run a 1 hour tutorial using this resource. The Coding cards are useful if you want to print (and maybe laminate) instructions for students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Once your students have completed this tutorial, they will be prepared for animating their own story. This is a great way to make cross curricular connections. They will need to prepare by planning their story, and creating the assets - this could be finding images online, taking photographs, or drawing (then photographing the results.)
