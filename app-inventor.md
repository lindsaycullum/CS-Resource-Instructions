## Getting Started with App Inventor

  <li>Click <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/Intro/courseinabox" target="_blank">here</a> to explore the course-in-a-box modeled after Professor David Wolber's work at the University of San Francisco. Note that the instructions explain downloading software to lab computers. The application is now all web based, so this is not required. The beginning of this course is suitable for junior students, and like Scratch, has students follow cookie-cutter tutorials to develop skills, and then introduces challenges that allows them to apply these skills in a creative way.<p></p></li>
