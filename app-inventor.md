## Getting Started with App Inventor

<ol>
  <li>Click <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/Intro/courseinabox" target="_blank">here</a> to explore the course-in-a-box modeled after Professor David Wolber's work at the University of San Francisco. The beginning of this course is suitable for junior students, and like Scratch, includes challenges that allows students to apply coding skills in a creative way. 
    <p>Click on the <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/Intro/IHaveADream" target="_blank" ><img src="images/IHaveADreamButton.png" alt="I have a Dream Button"></a> to get a feel for building a first app. This tutorial has students create an app that plays Dr. Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech when the user clicks on the image.</p><p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Once your students have completed this tutorial and dabbled with the App Inventor environment, they will be prepared to create a similar app. The course-in-a-box has some suggestions for open ended projects, such as:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Meet our team:</u> Introduces members of a team, clicking on faces plays a recording of each person saying something.</li>
      <li><u>Welcome to our school:</u> Shows areas of school/classroom, clicking on image plays a recording describing each area.</li>
      <li><u>Cross curriculum project:</u> An interactive way to connect images and oral excerpts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
