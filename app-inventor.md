    <p>Note that the instructions explain downloading software to lab computers. The application is now all web based, so this is not required.</p><p></p> 
    <p>The beginning of this course is suitable for junior students, and like Scratch, has students follow cookie-cutter tutorials to develop skills, and then introduces challenges that allows them to apply these skills in a creative way.<p></p></li>
