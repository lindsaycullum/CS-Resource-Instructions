## Getting Started with App Inventor

<ol>
  <li>Click <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/Intro/courseinabox" target="_blank">here</a> to explore the course-in-a-box modeled after Professor David Wolber's work at the University of San Francisco. 
    <p>Click on the <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/Intro/IHaveADream" target="_blank" ><img src="images/IHaveADreamButton.png" alt="I have a Dream Button"></a> to try out the first beginner app. This tutorial has students create an app that plays Dr. Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech when the user clicks on the image.</p><p></p>
    
    <p>The beginning of this course is suitable for junior students, and like Scratch, has students follow cookie-cutter tutorials to develop skills, and then introduces challenges that allows them to apply these skills in a creative way.<p></p></li>

  <li>Click <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/ai2apps/simpleApps" target="_blank">here</a> to explore tutorials for basic apps that are easy enough for students who are experienced with Scratch. <p>Note that the instructions explain downloading software to lab computers. The application is now all web based, so this is not required.</p><p></p>  </li>
