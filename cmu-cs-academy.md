## Getting Started with CMU CS Academy

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Academy</a> is an online platform that teachers may use (for free!!) to deliver high quality, interactive instruction in Python. This is an easy way to provide those who are fed up with drag and drop (Scratch, App Inventor) to get their feet wet writing lines of code. Activities are auto-marked, so students get immediate feedback. Program can be run as self-directed, so teacher is able to focus on helping the students who are struggling. CS0 course could be suitable for grades 5/6.
